        <p>Leonard "Leon" Borchardt (April 26, 1862 – death date unknown), better known as Oofty Goofty, was a German sideshow performer who lived in San Francisco, California in the late 19th century and Houston, Texas in the early 20th century.</p>

        <p>Author Herbert Asbury wrote that he got the name "Oofty Goofty" from a February 1884 appearance at a Market Street sideshow, where he was billed as the "Wild Man of Borneo".</p>

        <p>He was covered from head to toe with road tar, into which horsehair was stuck. This gave him a savage and ferocious appearance. He was then locked in a cage, and people paid a dime to look at the “wild man” supposedly captured in the jungles of Borneo and brought to San Francisco at enormous expense. To add to the realism, large chunks of raw meat were poked between the bars by an attendant, and the wild man gobbled ravenously, occasionally growling, shaking the bars, and yelping, “Oofty goofty! Oofty goofty.”</p>

        <p>Afterwards he worked as baseball team mascot. After losing several games, the baseball team kicked him and made him walk several hundred miles back home.</p>

        <p>In June 1885 he was charged with libel after claiming a man named C. Linear had offered him $200 to burn his house down. By that time he had already become known as Oofty Goofty, and had previously been a "What-is-it?" in a dime museum. Days later he was put into the Home of the Inebriates and was to be examined by the insanity commissioners. His status as a deserter was made known and he was sentenced to three years in military prison. He attempted to fake epileptic fits, but his ruse was uncovered. He later injured himself by jumping off a cliff and was released from service September 18, 1885. He then made his way back to San Francisco.</p>
